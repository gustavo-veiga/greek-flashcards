This file attempts to convert Bible Works Hebrew font encoding to Unicode.
The input file should be a 2 column CSV file: Column 1 being the Hebrew word,
and column 2 being the definition.  The output file will be an almost usable
flashcard .flash lesson.  You will need to manual edit to add the lesson name
in the very first property in the file.
